# Datum Spreadsheets
Excel spreadsheets to assist with :

•	transformation of spatial data between geodetic datums (e.g. GDA94 to GDA2020)
•	conversion of coordinate systems (e.g. Geographic (lat, lon) to Cartesian),
•	projection of data to a map grid
•	common geodetic computations (e.g. azimuths, distances)

Detailed information about these spreadsheets and the geodetic operations they support is contained in the Geocentric Datum of Australia 2020 Technical Manual www.icsm.gov.au.
More general explanations of the concepts and terminology are available at the ICSM Fundamentals of mapping site  www.icsm.gov.au/mapping/index.html
